# Changing-Letters
A Java program which converts characters in a systematic way.

Here it has 3 methods: 

convertChar: It takes a character and check if that character exists in the KEY alphebet. If it exists than it checks the index in a way that if the index is a even number character doesn't change but if it is an odd number, than it changes the character with the one that in front of it in the KEY.

convertText: Has a for loop that takes all of the characters from the entered word and return the converted word which is optained by putting all of the letters to convertChar method.

countNumbers: Again it has for loop but now it takes all characters from converted word and counts the numbers in it. Program uses this method to give an attention if there is not numbers in the result.

At the end it can show all possible results.
